you have an "employees" table with columns "employee_id," "first_name," "last_name," and "salary." 
Write an SQL query to display employee names along with a column "salary_category," which categorizes employees into "Low," "Medium," or "High" based on their salary 

employee_id	first_name	last_name	salary
1	            John	Smith	28000
2	            Jane	Doe	45000
3	            Michael	Johnson	65000
4	            Sarah	Williams	52000
5	          Robert	Brown	18000


SELECT
  employee_id,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  salary,
  CASE
    WHEN salary <= 30000 THEN 'Low'
    WHEN salary > 30000 AND salary <= 60000 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'High'
  END AS salary_category
FROM
  employees;
